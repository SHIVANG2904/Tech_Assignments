                                                                      -------------------
                                                                      
Q1. Find the sum of all possible pairs in an array of N elements

    Given an array arr[] of N integers, the task is to find the sum of all the pairs possible from the given array. Note that,
    1.) (arr[i], arr[i]) is also considered as a valid pair.
    2.) (arr[i], arr[j]) and (arr[j], arr[i]) are considered as two different pairs.
    Examples:
        Input: arr[] = {1, 2}
        Output: 12
        All valid pairs are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (2, 2).
        1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12
        
Q2. Program to print all the distinct elements in an array. Distinct elements are nothing but the unique (non-duplicate) elements present in the given array.
    SAMPLE INPUT:
       ~ size of an array = 10
       ~ array elements = 5,3,2,9,7.6,4,5,9,1
   SAMPLE OUTPUT:
       ~ 3 2 7 6 4 1
       
Q3. Program to sort first half of an array in ascending and second half in descending order.
    Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, 8, 9, 7 }
    Output : arr[] = {2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7, 3, 1 }
    
Q4. Program to sort elements by frequency in a given array. You need to print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency and if 2 numbers have same frequency then 
    print the one which came first.
    Input: 2, 3, 5, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3, 2, 5, 2
    Output: 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 5 5 9 6
    
Q5. Program to find all triplets with the given sum in the given array. Given an array of integers and a sum value, we need to iterate through the array and find 
    all possible triplets that sum to the given value.
    For example:
        Consider the array: arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}. The given sum is -2. In the given array, the triplets with sum = -2 are {0, -3, 1} and {-1, 2, -3}.
