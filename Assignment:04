                                                                     Coding Assignment-4
                                                                     -------------------
                                                                     
Q1. Given an array of non-negative integers array. We need to find the largest palindrome in the array which is. If no such number exits then print -1.
    Input:
          4
          5 131 54545 1111118
          
    Output:
          54545
          
Q2. Program to find all the missing elements in the given range. we have two inputs:
    •  An array of integers
    •  The start value and end value of the range
    
For example, consider the array: arr = {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}. The start value is 1 and the end 
value is 5. This means the range is 1 to 5. Here the missing elements are 4 and 5.

Q3. Program to rearrange positive and negative numbers in an array by moving all 
negative numbers to the beginning and positive numbers to the end by 
maintaining the order of appearance of elements in the array.
  • Input: 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3 
  • Output: -1 -2 -3 1 2 3
  
Q4. Program to replace each element by its rank in the given array. Given an array 
of distinct integers, we need to replace each element of the array with its rank. 
The minimum value element will have the highest rank.
 Input array = {10, 8, 15, 12, 6, 20, 1}
 Output array = {4, 3, 6, 5, 2, 7, 1}
Q5. Program to reverse an array in groups of give size k.
Input: No of element – n - 11
Group Size – k - 3
Array of n element: 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 3, 5, 4, 2, 9, 1
Output: 9 6 2 3 8 7 2 4 5 1 9
