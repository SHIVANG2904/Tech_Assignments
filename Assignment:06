Coding Assignment-6
Q1. Program to find the frequency of characters in a string in O(n) time complexity.
Input: kiit
Output: k – 1
i – 2
t – 1
Q2. Program to check if two strings are anagrams or not. Two strings are given as 
input and those strings have to be checked if they are anagrams or not. 
Anagram means that both strings contain the same character set, only their 
order is different. Therefore, in both strings, the frequency of each letter must be 
the same. For example, strings "act" and "cat" are anagrams.
Q3. Program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
Input: teeterson
Output: r
Q4. Program to capitalize first and last letter of each word in a line. The basic 
algorithm is to keep track of the spaces and capitalize the letter before the space 
and after space. The first letter and the last letter of the given line should be 
capitalized.
There are only a few things that need to be considered:
 More than one occurrence of spaces between two words.
 There can be a single word like 'a' that needs to be capitalized.
 There may be two words like "me" where both letters must be capitalized.
Input: kiit university
Output: KiiT UniversitY
Q5. In a mathematics class, Jason the mathematics teacher asked to solve a book of 
expressions consisting of characters, operators, and brackets. But Jason wants to 
give simplified expressions by removing brackets from the expressions. Write an 
algorithm to help Jason simplify an expression by removing brackets
Input: x-(p+q)+(y-a)
Output: x-p+q+y-a
